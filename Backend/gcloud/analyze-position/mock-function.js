As a ${playerLevel || 'beginner'} player, your main goals are:
1. Control the center of the board with pawns (e4 or d4 are strong first moves)
2. Develop your knights and bishops to active squares
3. Castle early to protect your king
4. Connect your rooks by moving the queen

White has the first move advantage. Common openings include 1.e4 (King's Pawn), 1.d4 (Queen's Pawn), or 1.Nf3 (RÃ©ti Opening).`;

As a ${playerLevel || 'beginner'} player, this is a critical moment:
1. Moving the pawn to b8 will allow promotion, typically to a queen
2. Promotion to a queen gives you a massive material advantage
3. After promotion, focus on checkmating the opponent's king
4. Be careful of stalemate positions - make sure the king has legal moves

This is a winning position for White with proper play.`;

2. Look for tactical opportunities and threats
3. Develop pieces toward the center
