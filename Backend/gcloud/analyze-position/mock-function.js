This is the starting position of a chess game.

Key points for a beginner:
1. Control the center with pawns (e4 or d4 are strong first moves)
2. Develop your knights and bishops to active squares
3. Castle early to protect your king
4. Don't move the same piece multiple times in the opening

Good first moves include e4 (King's Pawn Opening), d4 (Queen's Pawn Opening), or Nf3 (RÃ©ti Opening).
    `;
  } else {
    return `
The starting position offers equal chances for both sides, but White has the advantage of the first move.

For an ${playerLevel} player:
1. Consider your opening repertoire goals - development, space, or preparing for a specific structure
2. Common first moves like e4 and d4 fight for central control, while Nf3, c4, or g3 can transpose into various systems
3. Your first few moves should establish your pawn structure intentions and rapid development

The position is objectively equal (0.0) but White's first move advantage provides initiative.

Tactical analysis of this promotion position:

This position features a white pawn on the 7th rank (b7) about to promote. This is a decisive tactical motif.

1. The tactic here is straightforward: push the pawn to b8 and promote to a queen
2. After promoting, you'll have a material advantage of 9 points (the value of a queen)
3. Be careful about creating stalemate - make sure the black king has legal moves after you promote

The evaluation is +9.8, clearly winning for White because of the imminent promotion.
    `;

    return `
This position shows a white pawn on the 7th rank about to promote.

For a ${playerLevel} player:
1. Your immediate plan is to promote the pawn to a queen by playing b7-b8=Q
2. After promotion, you'll have a winning material advantage
3. Be careful not to create a stalemate - make sure the black king has legal moves
4. After promotion, use your queen to restrict the enemy king's movement, then deliver checkmate

This is a clearly winning position for White with proper play.

Tactical analysis of this position for a ${playerLevel} player:

${turn} to move. ${inCheck}

Looking at the tactical elements:
1. Check for immediate threats and tactical opportunities like pins, forks, or discovered attacks
2. Calculate forced sequences and ensure each move is safe before playing it
3. Be vigilant for your opponent's tactical possibilities

Without a full evaluation, focus on finding the most forcing moves - checks, captures, and threats - and calculate their consequences carefully.

Educational analysis of this position for a ${playerLevel} player:

${turn} to move. ${inCheck}

This position teaches important chess principles:
1. Piece coordination is essential - make sure your pieces work together
2. Control of the center provides greater mobility and options
3. King safety should always be a priority, especially in the middlegame
4. Always look for active piece placement rather than passive positioning

Remember that chess is about balancing multiple factors: material, king safety, piece activity, and pawn structure.

Key considerations:
