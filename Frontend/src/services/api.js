// Mock position explanations for different chess positions
const positionExplanations = {
  // Starting position
  'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR': `
This is the starting position of a chess game.

As a beginner player, your main goals are:
1. Control the center of the board with pawns (e4 or d4 are strong first moves)
2. Develop your knights and bishops to active squares
3. Castle early to protect your king
4. Connect your rooks by moving the queen

White has the first move advantage. Common openings include 1.e4 (King's Pawn), 1.d4 (Queen's Pawn), or 1.Nf3 (RÃ©ti Opening).

  // White pawn promotion position
  '7k/1P6/8/8/8/8/8/K7': `
This position shows a white pawn on the 7th rank about to promote.

As a beginner player, this is a critical moment:
1. Moving the pawn to b8 will allow promotion, typically to a queen
2. Promotion to a queen gives you a massive material advantage
3. After promotion, focus on checkmating the opponent's king
4. Be careful of stalemate positions - make sure the king has legal moves

This is a winning position for White with proper play.
  `,

  // Black pawn promotion position
  'k7/8/8/8/8/8/1p6/K7': `
This position has a black pawn on the 2nd rank ready to promote.

As a beginner player, you should:
1. Advance the pawn to b1 and promote to a queen
2. Be careful of stalemate - make sure White's king has legal moves after you promote
3. With your new queen, you can quickly checkmate the white king
4. Keep your king safe while you execute the checkmate

This is a winning position for Black with accurate play.
  `,

  // Ruy Lopez position
  'r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R': `
This position resembles the Ruy Lopez opening after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6.

As a beginner player, understanding this popular opening helps:
1. White has developed the knight to a good square, attacking Black's e5 pawn
2. Black has defended with the knight, also developing a piece
3. White often continues with 3.Bb5, pinning the knight
4. This is one of the oldest and most respected openings in chess

Both sides are developing their pieces toward the center, following good opening principles.
